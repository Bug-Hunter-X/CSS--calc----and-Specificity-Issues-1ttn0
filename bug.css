The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but it can lead to unexpected results if not used correctly. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` might not work as expected in some scenarios.  Another issue is that CSS specificity can cause unexpected styles to override others, making it hard to trace the source of unexpected styling.
